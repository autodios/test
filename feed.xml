Collabortive drawing + storytelling project about California’s future, created for the Oakland Museum of California’s Natural Science Gallery. A space for reflection and conversation about the impacts of humans on the environment, global shifts and possibilities both dire and hopeful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/articles/futures/sort1.png&quot; alt=&quot;splash&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience consists of two primary components: a large-scale, immersive visualization as well as several “input stations” where visitors can build off of previous ideas, as well as add their own. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Created &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antievictionmappingproject.net/ellis.html&quot;&gt;a series of maps&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, a data-visualization and digital storytelling collective working to document the housing crisis in San Francisco, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antievictionmappingproject.net/ellis.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/articles/ellis-evictions/thumb1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ellis&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Animated map of Ellis Act Evictions in San Francisco, 2007-2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h1&gt; About &lt;/h1&gt;
Each individual dot on these maps is a building in which all of the residents were evicted through no fault of their own. The size of the dots corresponds to the number of units in each building, and the map is animated to show the cumulation of these evictions over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data used in these maps comes from the SF Rent Board and the SF Planning Commission. Maps showing housing data are nothing new, and have frequently been created by real estate companies and the assessors office to provide information to home buyers and landlords. These real estate maps are created with the very specific purposes of expediting the process of buyng and selling houses, in other words of displaying the economic rather than the human side of the housing market.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a collective of activists and techworkers, the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project is interested in exploring and exposing the power relationships underpinning housing changes in the Bay Area. Some driving questions in this project have been:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would a map of housing data created from the perspective of tenants, rather than home-buyers, look like?  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways is data perceived as “objective”, while actually reinforcing existing hierarchies of power and points of view?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can a visualization evoke a more human realtionship to the data it represents?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    Most maps of housing data are created by real estate companies, for the purpose of helping people decide which houses to buy. These maps focus on the economic value of each of these transactions, and the resulting geographic territory is displayed as blocks of color [in an economic landscape]. Data about the housing market is collected by the assesors office and real estate companies in order to expedite these economic transactions. The goal of these maps is to obscure the human underpinnings of each of these transactions.

&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Sounds of each animal are represented by colorful, dynamic dots that change appearance according to pitch and intensity. Sounds are located in 3d space, so that shifting perspective changes both the imagery and the perceived locations of the different sounds. By touching a sound dot, the viewer can isolate that sound and discover which animal makes each noise. 
&lt;/br&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2013 20:00:00 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Animated map of flight paths of the California Condor, with a side-panel that shows the “condor-eye-view” as rendered in Google Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/articles/condors/fullscreen.png&quot; alt=&quot;splash&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/articles/condors/loop.png&quot; alt=&quot;splash&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animated paths were created in Processing, by plotting a the location at each incremental hour of the Condor’s flight, and then saving the frame. The thickness of the path at each point varies according to the elevation of the underlying terrain, giving the paths a hand-drawn, organic feel. 
I used GoogleEarth Javascript API to capture the view at each coordinate and angle of view (tangent) along the path. A NodeJS server communicated between the Processing App and the Javascript API to keep them in sync, and communicated with terminal to take a screenshot of the Google Earth window at each point in the Condor’s trajectory. Finally, I assembled the 100,000 frames into a video.&lt;/p&gt;

OAKLAND THEN AND NOW: photo &amp;amp; map-based exploration of past and present habitats, created for the Natural Sciences gallery at Oakland Museum of California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/116558796?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff&amp;amp;autoplay=1&amp;amp;loop=1&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;393&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Located in the “Nature in Oakland” section of the Sciences gallery, this interactive experience connects scientific information about Oakland vegetation with real places that are familiar to the vistor. The map is based off of historical ecology data provided by ecologist Todd Keeler-Wolf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors to the museum can touch a point on a modern map of Oakland and see their house, school, or favorite park juxtaposed with images of what that place used to look like. The photo-based nature of the experience connects to things that people intuitively know about what they see in their neighborhood: we are not simply told that a particular swath of land used to be ‘Coastal Grassland’, but can see visual similarities between patches of grass still in the neighborhood and the grassland that used to be there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on this project as a developer and cartographer has been an iterative process to figure out how to best use technology to create an accessible and responsive interface, and how to move beyond a map with abstract color blocks into something more relatable and intuitive to human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
